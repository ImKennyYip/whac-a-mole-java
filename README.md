## Homework:
You can continue working on this project if you like. One feature you can add is a reset button so that you can restart the game without having to rerun the program. As a follow up task, you can also add a variable to keep track of a high score. If you want a challenge, you can also add multiple piranha plants. You should store these piranha plants in an array.
